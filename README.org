* A Shen implementation of miniKanren
#+ATTR_HTML: align=center

shen-minikanren is a [[http://www.shenlanguage.org][Shen]] implementation of [[http://minikanren.org][miniKanren]], an embedded
DSL for logic programming. It was adapted with Will Byrd's Scheme
[[http://github.com/miniKanren/TheReasonedSchemer/][sources]], which follow the definition of miniKanren given in the
appendix of The Reasoned Schemer.

shen-minikanren integrates seamlessly into Shen's type system. This
form (example 1.54 in The Reasoned Schemer) type checks as:

#+BEGIN_SRC shen
 (60+) (run* R
     (fresh (X Y)
	     (conde
	      ((=== split X)
	       (=== pea Y))
	      ((=== navy X) (=== bean Y))
	       (else mk-fail))
	      (=== [X Y] R)))
 [[split pea] [navy bean]] : (list (walkable symbol))
#+END_SRC

The files that make up the implementation should be loaded into a Shen
REPL in this order:

+ macros.shen (with tc -)
+ types.shen (with tc +)
+ minikanren.shen (with tc +)
+ prelude.shen (with tc +)

Examples are given in tests.shen and prelude.shen, all of which come
from The Reasoned Schemer and Will Byrd's sources.
